Filtering and obtaining datasets from Transportation department, Housing department, market value ,crime rate and so forth of datasets of the Greater Boston area.

With this information, we can calculate the CPI Consumer Price Index. As described by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - 'The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services'.
Typically a market basket consist of Housing, Transportation, Medical care, Good and Services. Accumulating these will results in a number which when compare within city, we will be able to find price inflation among city of Greater Boston.
