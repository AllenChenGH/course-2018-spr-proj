This is the top of our README file for our first project. 

We are trying to find out if there is complimentarity between the MBTA services (bus, subway) and the Hubway system in the Greater Boston Area. 

In this instance, we focus only on subway routes- bus routes should be added to this analysis in order to have a better view of the role of Hubway in Bostonians' transportation choices.
