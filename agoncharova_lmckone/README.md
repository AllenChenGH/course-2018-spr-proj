### Luboc McKone and Anna Goncharova: Project 1


1. **Foursqare API:**

	We queried the Foursquare API to get data about businesses in the Boston and San Fransisco areas. To work around Foursquare's query limit of 50 data points per request, we created a lattice of longitute and latitude points. We preserved unique data points returned with our query for "Office" and different longitute and latitude pairs. In total, we were able to retrieve 1208 data points for SF and 1478 data points for Boston. 
	
	**Some Limitations with this data source:** 

	* The Secret key to be used for the requests has to be reset frequently. 
	* The data does not contain any time references, so it is unlikely that we will be using it to see development over time. However, it is still a great for a quick reference for business activity in a certain area or part of a city.
