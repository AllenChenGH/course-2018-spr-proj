I used the Fire Incident reports in Boston from May, September, and December of 2017. I first transformed the data to include only the unique incident numbers and the address, then I used geocoder to convert the addresses to latitude and longitude points. I then used that information to do three K-Means for each of the months. I wanted to determine if during the month of September, the fire incidents clustered closer to areas that students live in, such as Allston and Medford.
