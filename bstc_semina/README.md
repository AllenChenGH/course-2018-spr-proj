We have used the following five datasets to examine different restaurants and businesses:
Code Enforcement - Building and Property Violations (Analyze Boston), FOOD ESTABLISHMENT INSPECTIONS (Analyze Boston), Yelp Fusion, Google Places, Foursquare Places.
We combined the different rating systems from the 3 rating website, Google, Yelp, and Foursquare. 
This gave us an average evaluation of each business from customers.
Then we used the health inspection data and property violation data to understand the effects these have on a customer's perception of a business.
The fundamental question we could look to answer is: Are businesses affected by health code and property violations, and if so, to what degree?
To solve this question, one could compare average ratings for a business based on their number and severity of violations.
Alternitively, the ratings and violations could be modelled as functions of time to see if there is cause and affect between the two.
