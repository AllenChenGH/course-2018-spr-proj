The problem we are addressing is the advent of Uber and Lyft, where people are increasingly using these less environmentally friendly services for the sake of convenience. Our solution combines data from Hubway and MBTA indepedently and utilizing them to find the optimal way to get to their favorite entertainment/restaurant locations. We used k-means to find the best travel method to these locations and compare those results with Uber. The data we pulled from entertainment/restaurants have been filtered extensively to find only the passing-grade locations. We decided to combine Entertainment and Food to one dataset to better organize and filter repeat data and targeting only the location (which must be in Boston area) and business name.
